📊 Telecom Churn Analysis
🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies. In this project, I built an end-to-end churn analysis pipeline using PostgreSQL for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization.

The goal was to analyze why customers leave, identify high-risk segments, and uncover key business insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

PostgreSQL → Data storage, quality checks, null handling, production table creation

SQL → Data cleaning & transformation (using COALESCE, null checks, etc.)

Power BI → Dashboard creation & business insights visualization

Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive Telecom Churn Dashboard to track churn trends.

📌 KPIs & Visuals Included

Total Customers, New Joiners, Churn Count, Churn Rate

Churn by Gender

Churn Rate by Age Group

Churn by Payment Method

Churn by Category (Competitor, Dissatisfaction, etc.)

State-wise Churn Hotspots

States like Jammu & Kashmir face the highest churn (59%)

📘 Learnings
